Landscaper is a fictional Rails application that allows a landscaping company to receive job orders for customers. 
A customer can go to the website and  put in an job request, indicating which tasks they require for the job. An employee can also sign in and view what jobs they have available. Only employees have the ability to alter jobs, once they've been created. Employees can go and edit a job to complete. This will help keep track of what jobs are complete and what is still open. 

Installation - Fork the repository - Clone the file to your computer - Change into the proper directory - Run 'bundle' - Run 'rails db:migrate' - Run 'rails s' to start the server. Once the server is running, you can copy and paste the URL given within the terminal to view the app through a webpage.
